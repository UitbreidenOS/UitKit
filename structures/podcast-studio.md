# Podcast Studio — Claude Instructions

## What this is

This workspace manages end-to-end podcast operations: guest prospecting, pre-interview
research, recording session prep, editing workflow, show notes production, multi-platform
distribution, social clip strategy, email marketing, sponsorship sales, and analytics.

The show publishes weekly. All episode work lives in episodes/<ep-slug>/. Do not draft
anything outside that structure.

## Stack

- Remote recording: Riverside.fm — separate audio/video tracks, local backup enabled
- Editing + transcription: Descript — word-based editing, Studio Sound noise removal
- Hosting: Buzzsprout — RSS feed, Spotify/Apple auto-distribution, download analytics
- Website: Podpage — auto-generated from Buzzsprout RSS; refresh after each publish
- Email: ConvertKit — episode broadcast sequence, premium subscriber segment (tag: premium)
- Payments: Stripe — $9/month premium tier (bonus episodes, ad-free feed)
- Distribution: Spotify for Podcasters, Apple Podcasts Connect, YouTube (video podcast)
- Clips: Descript (clip export), Headliner (audiograms), CapCut (Reels/TikTok)
- Analytics: Buzzsprout stats + Chartable (cross-platform attribution)

## Directory conventions

- episodes/<ep-slug>/ — one folder per episode; copy from episodes/_template/
- episodes/_template/ — master template; never publish directly from this folder
- production/ — SOPs and checklists; update when the workflow changes, not per episode
- guests/ — prospect pipeline and templates; past-guests/ for archived per-guest records
- marketing/social-templates/ — reusable frameworks; populate per episode in episode folder
- monetization/ — live sponsor contracts in sponsor-tracker.md; rates in ad-rates.md
- analytics/ — update episode-performance.md at day 7 and day 30 post-publish

## Episode folder naming

Format: ep<NNN>-<guest-or-topic-slug>
Examples: ep042-sarah-jones, ep043-ai-in-healthcare, ep044-solo-q-and-a

## Common tasks — exact commands

**Scaffold a new episode folder:**
/new-episode number=043 guest="First Last" topic="[topic]" record-date="YYYY-MM-DD"

**Generate show notes from transcript:**
/show-notes transcript=episodes/ep043-[slug]/transcript.md guest="First Last" links="[comma-separated URLs]"

**Create launch-week social copy:**
/social-promo episode=episodes/ep043-[slug]/shownotes.md platforms="linkedin,twitter,instagram,youtube"

**Draft a guest outreach email:**
/guest-outreach guest="First Last" company="[Company]" topic="[pitch angle]" warm="[mutual contact or no]"

**Write a sponsorship proposal:**
/sponsor-pitch sponsor="[Brand]" format="mid-roll" episodes=4 rate=episodes

**Generate ConvertKit episode email:**
/newsletter-episode shownotes=episodes/ep043-[slug]/shownotes.md subject-variants=3

**Pull episode performance summary:**
/performance-review episode=episodes/ep043-[slug]/performance.md period=30d

## Recording conventions

- Riverside.fm: always enable local recording backup before starting; check guest's mic in
  first 30 seconds; stop and re-record if audio is below -24 LUFS peak
- Audio export from Descript: 128kbps MP3, 44.1kHz, stereo, -16 LUFS integrated
- Episode file naming for Buzzsprout upload: show-name-ep043-guest-slug.mp3
- Timestamps in transcript.md use HH:MM:SS format; chapter markers match shownotes.md

## Show notes conventions

- Summary: 3-4 sentences, no fluff, front-load the guest's main insight
- Key takeaways: 3-5 bullet points, each actionable or quotable
- Guest bio: 2 sentences max, link to their site and LinkedIn
- Resources: every link mentioned in the episode, labeled clearly
- Chapter timestamps: every segment boundary, minimum 5 chapters per episode
- CTA: one primary CTA (subscribe, review, or premium) — never stack three CTAs

## Distribution checklist (run after Buzzsprout upload)

1. Confirm Spotify auto-submit delivered within 4 hours of publish
2. Submit to Apple Podcasts Connect if manual approval required
3. Refresh Podpage (Settings > Refresh Feed)
4. Upload video version to YouTube with description from social-promo.md
5. Schedule ConvertKit broadcast for 8 AM listener timezone (Tuesday preferred)
6. Post social clips: LinkedIn same day, Twitter/X thread day 2, Instagram day 3
7. Log episode in analytics/episode-performance.md

## Monetization conventions

- Ad placements: pre-roll 60s (max), mid-roll 90s at the 20-minute mark, post-roll 30s
- Host-read ads only — no dynamically inserted ads below 10k downloads/episode
- Sponsor copy lives in the episode outline.md under "AD BREAK" markers
- New sponsor rates require approval; use ad-rates.md tiers, never negotiate below floor
- Log every deliverable and payment in monetization/sponsor-tracker.md same day

## Analytics cadence

- Day 7 post-publish: log downloads in analytics/episode-performance.md
- Day 30: update with 30-day total and completion rate from Spotify for Podcasters
- Monthly: update analytics/growth-dashboard.md with subscriber count and MoM delta
- Quarterly: run listener survey; archive results in analytics/audience-survey-YYYY-QN.md
