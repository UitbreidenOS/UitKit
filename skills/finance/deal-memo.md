# Deal Memo Skill

## When to activate
- Writing a deal memo after a first or second meeting with a founder
- Synthesizing diligence findings into a structured investment recommendation
- Presenting a new deal to your partners or IC for the first time
- Building the investment thesis before IC memo — deal memo is the earlier, more exploratory document
- Preparing a VC-style deal memo for seed, Series A, or growth rounds

## When NOT to use
- Formal IC memos requiring financial model sign-off — use `/ic-memo` for that
- PE buyout analysis — deal memo format differs (use PE-specific templates)
- Public market investment theses — different format and regulatory requirements
- Preliminary deal screens — use `/deal-screening` before investing time in a memo

## Important

Deal memos contain investment recommendations based on limited diligence. Mark all unverified claims as `[UNVERIFIED]`. Financial projections are founder-provided unless stated otherwise — always disclose the source.

### Market thesis section

```
Write the Market Opportunity section of a deal memo.

Company: [name]
Category: [what space they're in]

Market sizing:
- TAM: $[X]B — [how calculated: top-down / bottom-up / [UNVERIFIED]]
- SAM (addressable given product scope): $[X]B

[ ] Incumbent failure to adapt: [describe]
[ ] New distribution channel unlocked: [describe]

Key tailwinds: [list 3]
Key risks to market thesis: [list 2]

Write a 200-word market opportunity section that argues why this market is large, growing, and winnable — and why this is the right time to invest.
```

---

### Team assessment section

```
Write the Team section of a deal memo.

Founders:
[For each founder: Name, role, prior companies, relevant expertise, notable achievements]

Assess against these dimensions:
1. Domain expertise: do they know this space deeply?
2. Technical ability: can they build the product?
3. Commercial ability: can they sell and tell the story?
4. Prior founder experience: first time or repeat?
5. Coachability signals (from references or conversation): [any notes]
6. Team completeness: what key roles are missing?

Write a balanced team assessment — strengths and gaps. Do not over-inflate. VCs who present every team as "world-class" lose credibility.
```

---

### Unit economics and financials section

```
Write the Financial Overview and Unit Economics section.

Metrics provided by company ([UNVERIFIED] unless audited):
- ARR: $[X]M, growing [X]% YoY
- MRR: $[X]M
- Gross margin: [X]%

- Churn: [X]% monthly / [X]% annual gross churn
- Net revenue retention: [X]%
- Burn rate: $[X]M/month
- Current ARR per employee: $[X]K

Benchmarks for comparison (SaaS, seed to Series A):
- Good gross margin: >70%
- Good LTV/CAC: >3x
- Healthy net revenue retention: >100%
- Efficient burn: <18 months runway at current rate

Write the financial overview section. Flag any metrics that are below benchmark. Note which figures are unverified and what we need to confirm in diligence.
```

---

### Risk factors section

```
Write the Risk Factors section for this deal.

Company: [name], [stage], [industry]

Evaluate these risk categories:
1. Market risk: is the market real and large enough?
2. Product risk: can they build it / does it work at scale?
3. Team risk: founder-market fit, key person dependency
4. Competition risk: can incumbents replicate or acquire competitors?
5. Technology risk: AI disruption, API dependency, platform risk
6. Regulatory risk: any pending regulation that could change the landscape?
7. Fundraising risk: how much runway do they have and what triggers the next round?
8. Customer concentration: does one customer represent >20% of revenue?

For each risk: [Risk] | [Probability: High/Med/Low] | [Impact: High/Med/Low] | [Mitigant or open question]

Prioritise the top 5. Flag which risks need resolution before we can invest.
```

### Diligence checklist

```
Generate a pre-IC diligence checklist for a [stage] investment in [sector].

Based on what I know:
- Known gaps: [list anything you couldn't verify from founder conversations]

Generate a checklist covering:
[ ] Financial diligence: [what to request from the company]

## Example

**User:** I just met with the founders of a seed-stage B2B AI company that automates legal contract review. 2 co-founders — one former BigLaw attorney, one engineering lead from a major legal tech firm. $400K ARR, growing 30% MoM, 4 enterprise pilots. Raising $3M seed at $15M pre-money. 18 months runway.

**Expected output:** A full deal memo covering market (legal tech $X0B, AI disruption timing), team (excellent domain/technical fit, missing enterprise sales leader), unit economics (prompt for LTV/CAC verification), competitive landscape (Harvey, Ironclad, Kira as comps), risk factors (customer concentration in pilots, regulatory around AI in legal advice, enterprise sales GTM), and a recommendation section that either leans in or passes with clear rationale. All founder-provided financial figures marked [UNVERIFIED].
